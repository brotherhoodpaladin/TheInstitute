# The Institute (TheInstitute.esp)
A mod for improvements to make The Institute a cleaner and more technologically advanced place.

## Mod Changes
1. Removed leaf piles in Institute Concourse.
2. Removed rubble piles on floor in Institute Concourse Molecular Relay area.
3. All Institute Sliding Doors are now auto-closable.. The doors close automatically (default: 5 seconds). The doors will automatically lock if set (default: false). Both settings are configurable.
4. Added more Institute Bottled Water (10) and Institute Food Packets (25) to Commissary vendor.
5. Added additional buff to Institute Food. Restores Health 5 points/sec for 10s instead of 2.5. Wasteland Survival Perk changes it to 10 points/per second for 10s.
6. Added unique food item to Commissary called Food Supplement 77.
7. Added lore holotapes and technical data for mysterious Food Supplement 77.
8. Added a bed in the Director's Quarters. The bed is scrappable. I moved some of the items in the room to accommodate the bed, but did not scrap, disable, or otherwise remove their references. I did this because unless you install other mods with some of the Institute furniture, you can not add an Institute bed without the use of the Creation Kit.
9. Added requisition holotape in private room on desk. The holotape allows you to requisition specific materials with a default game cost to keep it lore friendly. It provides a materiel requisition that works like a shipment in the vanilla game. This materiel requisition can be added to a work bench to receive the requisitioned item.
